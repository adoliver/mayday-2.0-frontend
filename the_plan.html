        <p id="plan-byline" class="byline">The Plan to Reclaim our Representative Democracy</p>
        <p id="progress-clearance">Our framers gave us a &ldquo;representative democracy&rdquo; &ndash; what they called, &ldquo;a Republic.&rdquo; But that Republic was to be representative of all of us. Congress, as Madison said, was to be &ldquo;dependent on the People alone.&rdquo; And by &ldquo;the People,&rdquo; as he explained, they meant &ldquo;not the rich more than the poor.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>We have allowed Congress to betray this fundamental commitment. We don&rsquo;t have a representative branch “dependent on the people alone.” Instead we have a Congress “dependent on their funders” as well as “on the people.” That dependency produces a government obsessed with the interests of “the rich more than the poor” &ndash; since obviously the rich are the funders. Less than 2% of America gave anything to any political campaign last year. The top 100 <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/top-political-donors-113833.html" target="_blank">gave as much</a> as the bottom 4.75 million.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="problem" class="col-md-9">
      <h2>The Problem: Election Funding</h2>
        <p>This is the root problem in America's democracy: how we fund campaigns. We have outsourced the funding of campaigns to the tiniest fraction of the 1% &ndash; dominated by cronies and special interests, and by too many who care too little about the good for America as a whole. That system for funding campaigns produces a Congress dominated by interests that don’t represent America. That dependence is a corruption.</p>
        <p>We need to change the way campaigns are funded to end this corruption. We need a system in which all of us &ndash; and not just the interested few &ndash; fund campaigns, so we can have a Congress dependent on all of us, and not just the interested few.</p>

    <div id="solution" class="col-md-9 grey-group">
      <h2>The Solution: Different Election Funding</h2>
      <p>We are launching a project to recruit Americans across the country to help convince members of Congress to be the leaders they were elected to be &ndash; by supporting fundamental reform in the way campaigns are funded.</p>
      <p>That sounds like an impossible task. But the solution is actually quite simple.</p>
      <p>Right now, members of Congress must raise huge sums of money to win elections. And that requires spending 30&ndash;70% of their time raising money from wealthy donors and special interests. The incentives are clear: more money = higher chance of getting elected. And more money comes from pleasing their donors, creating a system of cronyism.</p>
      <p>To fix this, we need to change from whom our representatives are raising their money &ndash; and with that change, we will change how they raise their money. That change will require legislation &ndash; but just legislation. A statute, requiring must a majority in Congress to enact it. </p>

    <div id="challenge" class="col-md-9">
      <h2>The Challenge: A Congress Committed to Reform</h2>
      <p>We are asking members of Congress to become leaders for reform, by cosponsor the legislation that will reverse the corrupting influence of money on our elections. Five pieces of legislation currently meet our standards for a more inclusive way of funding political campaigns: two from Democrats, two from Republicans, and one bipartisan proposal. To learn more about these plans, visit <a href="http://repswith.us" target="_blank">RepsWith.US</a></p>
      <p>Whether we give ordinary Americans more influence in our elections through matching their donations, providing vouchers, or instituting tax credits is not important to right now. They key is get a majority committed to fundamental reform. </p>
      <p>Our strategy is to start by targeting the members of Congress most likely to support reform: those who are new to Congress and those who have supported reform in the past but have not yet recommitted in the 114th Congress. Already, more than 200 Members have committed to reform. We must now close the gap.</p>

      <h2>The Mayday Lab: Getting a Congress committed to Reform</h2>
      <p>Our campaign will experiment with the most effective tools of persuasion: you. We are organizing grassroots campaigns to show members of Congress that doing the right thing for us is also the right thing for their political future. We want them to be leaders, and we’re going to give them every incentive &ndash; both positive and negative &ndash; that we can to inspire them to become leaders. </p>
      <p>As we experiment, we will double-down on what works and let go of what doesn't. Volunteers and supporters will play a vital role in creating a Congress committed to reform. And we are eager to hear from you about how to make this effort a success.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Mayday will focus on generating support for reform within the Congress we already have. As the 2016 election approaches, we will explore the most effective means for Mayday to make a difference.</p>
      <p>We are counting on you to be a part of our efforts to get our democracy back. Please <a href="/take-action">sign-up to take action</a> and spread the word to your friends and family. Too much is at stake to sit on the sidelines.</p>
